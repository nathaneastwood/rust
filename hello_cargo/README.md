## Hello, Cargo!

This is a rust "hello world" project built using `cargo`.

### Building

You can build this project with

```
cargo build
```

which will create an executable file in `target/debug/hello_cargo` which you can execute with

```
./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

### Running

We can also use `cargo run` to compile the code and then run the resulting executable all in one command.

### Checking

Cargo also provides a command called `cargo check`. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable.
